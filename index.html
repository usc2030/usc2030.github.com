    <h1>What's Up With the Master Plan?!!</h1>
    <br />
    <p>For a while, I have been hearing all this talk about a "Master Plan" that USC has been working on. Sound intimidating? Yeah, I thought so too. Curious, I decided to do some digging around of my own.</p>

      <h2>Here's the dirt.</h2>
      <p>A master plan is an outline charting the long-term growth of an institution.</p>
      <p>The current Master Plan is USC's outline for redeveloping six districts surrounding the campus. It will direct the course of development from now until the year 2030.</p>

    <h2>What Falls Through The Cracks</h2>
    <h3 class="numbers">1.</h3>
    <div class="first_critique">
      <h3>There still won't be enough student housing.</a></h3>
      <p>After the additional 4,200 beds are built, 
        <a class="housinglack" href="http://www.usc.edu/private/factbook/2011/all_byclass_11.pdf" target="_blank">the total number of USC-owned housing covers only 29% of students</a>. Keep in mind that USC has <a class="steadyincrease" href="http://articles.latimes.com/2011/nov/14/local/la-me-1114-foreign-students-20111114" target="_blank">steadily increased enrollment of international and out-of-state students,</a> for a net increase of 5,000 students by 2030.</p>

    <div class="second_critique">
      <h3>Many students can't afford the new private housing.</h3>
      <p>Privately-owned non-USC housing being built to house students is unaffordable with places like Gateway costing as much as $4,000 per apartment/month. <a class="financialaid" href="http://www.usc.edu/admission/fa/" target="_blank">Meanwhile, more than 60% of students are on financial aid.</a></p>

    <div class="third_critique">
      <h3>Private housing can push residents out of the area.</h3>
      <p><p title="Committee Transmittal: Affordable Housing Addendum to Report Back Relative to the University of Southern California Development Agreement Nexus Study p. 9">This private housing will also raise overall rent prices in the area. Those who can't afford it will be forced to find housing elsewhere. <a class="planningdept" href="https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B2EX_7CWIxrtZjVoOTFuN3lRektET0ZaaG5XV0VYdw" target="_blank">The city's planning department study of the area around USC shows a loss of 1,300 affordable units over the next five years.</a></p></p>

      <h3>Current retailers will be displaced.</h3>
      <p>Current retailers at the University Village have to find a new location during the two-year construction of District 3-a tall order for many of the mom and pop shops.</p>

    <h2>Why does any of this matter?</h2>
    <p class="beginningparagraph">Seeing as most students only spend 4 years (or less) at USC, most of us probably won't even be here once these developments are completed.</p>
    <p class="emphasis">But we can decide what to do.</p>
    <p class="lastparagraph">This master plan, like the one before it, will impact the area around USC for years to come. In 2030,<span id="slant"> if we speak up</span>, there can be many community residents still living here, just as they have been for decades. There can be future Trojans, who experience a USC that has learned how to grow <span id="itali">with</span> its neighbors, a USC we have an opportunity to shape- that is, if we take it.</p>
